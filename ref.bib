abstract = {This paper examines whether new refined measures of consumer sentiment expectations exert a significant effect on household deposit flows across Eurozone’s member countries. The new measures of sentiment-based expectations of consumers are constructed following a principal component analysis of selected individual answers as part of Eurostat’s consumer sentiment survey across the Eurozone’s member countries. Employing a Bayesian panel VAR model to increase the accuracy of our results, we document that a (positive) shock on consumers’ sentiment expectations triggers an imminent positive response of household deposits that gradually reverses during the next 2–3 months. This main result extends and complements traditional explanations for depositors’ behavior in the extant literature. Our results have important implications for Eurozone’s households, policymakers, central bankers, and commercial banks.}

abstract = {It is widely understood that the real price of globally traded commodities is determined by the forces of demand and supply. One of the main determinants of the real price of commodities is shifts in the demand for commodities associated with unexpected fluctuations in global real economic activity. There have been numerous proposals for quantifying global real economic activity. We discuss which criteria a measure of global real activity must satisfy to be useful for modeling industrial commodity prices, we examine which of the many alternative measures in the literature are most suitable for applied work, and we explain why some popular measures are inappropriate for modeling industrial commodity prices. Given these insights, we examine the question of whether there has been a slowdown in global real economic activity between 2011 and 2016 and by how much. Drawing on a range of new evidence, we show that the global commodity price boom of the 2000s appears to have been largely transitory and that the partial recovery after 2016 has been fueled by the strength of advanced economies rather than China. Our analysis has important implications for the design of structural models of commodity markets, for the analysis of the transmission of commodity price shocks to commodity-importing and -exporting economies, and for commodity price forecasting.}

abstract = {There is growing evidence that the primary effect of energy price shocks on the U.S. economy involves a reduction in consumer spending. We quantify the direct effect on real consumption of unanticipated changes in discretionary income, shifts in precautionary savings, and changes in the operating cost of energy-using durables. The possibility of asymmetries in the response of real consumption to energy price shocks is also considered. We demonstrate that linear models are consistent with the symmetric behavior of real consumption in 1979 (when energy prices increased sharply) and in 1986 (when they fell sharply). It is shown that historically energy price shocks have been an important factor in explaining U.S. real consumption growth, but by no means the dominant factor.}

The indexes were examined for a priori information content about a number of important variables associated with forecasting product demand and aggregate buyer behavior patterns. The empirical findings suggest that the indexes are useful in predicting future values of aggregate consumer spending and business and economic activity. The Michigan measure appears to outperform the Conference Board measure when predicting durable good purchases, whereas the reverse is true for general economic activity. Both measures are useful for predicting business activity.}

abstract = {Consumer sentiment analysis is a recent fad for social media-related applications such as healthcare, crime, finance, travel, and in academia. Disentangling consumer perception to gain insight into the desired objective and reviews is significant. With the advancement of technology, a massive amount of social web data increasing in volume, subjectivity, and heterogeneity becomes challenging to process manually. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been utilized to handle this difficulty in real-life applications. This paper presents a study to determine the usefulness, scope, and applicability of this alliance of ML techniques for consumer sentiment analysis (CSA) for online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. We show a systematic literature review to compare, analyse, explore, and understand the attempts and directions to find research gaps in illustrating the future scope of this pairing. The primary objective is to read and analyse the use of ML techniques for consumer sentiment analysis on online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. This research has significant implications for service providers in terms of developing managerial strategies for consumers in terms of selecting services that meet their needs. Furthermore, there is high impact for researchers in terms of prospective research directions.}

We consider whether consumer sentiment is able to predict the growth of household’s consumption, in addition to the growth of labor income. The empirical analysis finds that Consumer Confidence Indices (CCI) does predict the household’s consumption of durable goods. We also draw comparisons with recent analysis for the US. In addition, we analyze whether both the UK and US CCI are accurate and useful predictors of household’s consumption growth using directional analysis. We find that the UK confidence indicators predict better the US.}

abstract = {Business cycle analysts traditionally interpret consumer sentiment data as containing information about current and future consumer behaviour. One important attraction of these survey data is that they are readily available on a monthly basis. The evidence is mixed as to whether the information content of consumer sentiment can be captured by economic and financial variables such as interest rates, unemployment, stock market indices, etc. It is striking that often reference is made to variables capturing expectations and to the uncertainty surrounding these expectations, but that this is based on ad hoc interpretations of significant coefficients of variables as unemployment or inflation. We propose a more direct measure of expected economic conditions and uncertainty. More precisely, the average or consensus growth rate and the dispersion of forecasts (standard deviation or difference between maximum and minimum forecast) are tested in regressions for the sentiment of Belgian consumers. Both variables improve the quality of the regression dramatically.}

We predict that a wave of investor sentiment has larger effects on securities whose valuations are highly subjective and difficult to arbitrage. Consistent with this prediction, we find that when beginning-of-period proxies for sentiment are low, subsequent returns are relatively high for small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks, unprofitable stocks, non-dividend-paying stocks, extreme growth stocks, and distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, on the other hand, these categories of stock earn relatively low subsequent returns.},

abstract = {We build a model that helps to explain why increases in liquidity—such as lower bid–ask spreads, a lower price impact of trade, or higher turnover–predict lower subsequent returns in both firm-level and aggregate data. The model features a class of irrational investors, who underreact to the information contained in order flow, thereby boosting liquidity. In the presence of short-sales constraints, high liquidity is a symptom of the fact that the market is dominated by these irrational investors, and hence is overvalued. This theory can also explain how managers might successfully time the market for seasoned equity offerings, by simply following a rule of thumb that involves issuing when the SEO market is particularly liquid. Empirically, we find that: (i) aggregate measures of equity issuance and share turnover are highly correlated; yet (ii) in a multiple regression, both have incremental predictive power for future equal-weighted market returns.}
