# Dissertation Repo

This is the repository for my dissertation. this is where all the code for the cleaning, compilation and analysis of the data will be kept.

## Pillar 1 - Investor Sentiment

The investor sentiment index I will be creating/using is inspired by the index used by Baker and Wurgler (2007) which consists of:
- Trade Volume
  Baker and Stein (2004): should see an increase in liquidity (trade volume) when stocks are rising i.e. when sentiment is good
- Dividend Premium
  The difference between the average market-to-book-value ratios of dividend-paying stocks and non-paying stocks
  Fama and French (2001)
- Close-end fund discount
  Investment firms that issue a fixed number of shares, which then trade on the stock market. The discount is the difference between the NAV and the fund's market price
- The number of IPOs
- First-day returns on IPOs
- Equity share of new issues
  Measures all equity offerings, not just IPOs. A high equity share implies low stock market returns. This is because companies are shifting between equity and debt financing to reduce their overall cost of capital.

## Pillar 2

The retail sentiment index will be made up of Google Trends data.
- Unemployment benefits
- Indeed + LinkedIn
- Skyscanner + Emirates + Holiday (topic)
- Film
- DIY

I will also include the share price of the Everyman Media Group. The hypothesis on the inclusion of DIY is that in times of poor consumer sentiment, people will look to fix, build and renovate things themselves, rather than looking for new houses/professionals.

## Pillar 3 - Long Term Purchases

This is quite similar to investor sentiment but includes very specific longer-horizon investments
- Land sales volume
- Vehicle registrations
- ? Commercial real estate

## Pillar 4 - Market Sentiment

Otoo (Fed Reserve 2000) - there is a contemporaneous relationship between stock markets and consumer sentiment

- Gilt Spread
- FTSE 100/LSE average growth rate
- LSE diffusion index
- US diffusion index


## Pillar 5 - Misc
In this pillar, I address some additional indicators which do not necessarily fit into the other pillars or are specific to the UK. 
[] House price connectedness (HM Land Registry)
- [x] House price Diffusion Index (HM Land Registry)
The house price diffusion index measures the proportion of regions in the UK that saw an increase in the monthly average price of homes.
[] Job Vacancy Data (Bloomberg)
[] Away football match attendance (Football web pages) (specific to the UK)
