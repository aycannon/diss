Pillar 2: Retail Sentiment

I will use google trends to get data on the following:
Unemployment benefits
Indeed + LinkedIn
Skyscanner + Emirates + Holiday (topic)
Film 
DIY (with the hypothesis that during recessions DIY increases)


I hope to be able to utilise google trends as a way to show relatively how much people are searching for these items.
