Pillar 4: General state of the stock market

I will possibly make a stock market diffusion index here
possibly include US stocks in this as well (having 2 seperate diffusion indexes)

When it comes to the PCA, then we will be able to see what weightings to put on them both. it may be interesting to see that the US stock market may impact consumer sentiment more
